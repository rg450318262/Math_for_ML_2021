(1) How to use the Matlab codes in folder Weather_examples?

First run "WeatherData_from_Excel_to_mat.m". It will read in Excel files and save the data as a Matlab data file. 

Then you can run "NeuralNet_manual_plots.m" to examine the simple classifications of days based on either just the average temperature, or on temperature and air pressure data together. Here the two-neuron networks are not trained really; their parameters are simply chosen explicitly.
